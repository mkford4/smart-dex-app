# About the Project: Pokedex

Objective:
Build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JS that loads data from an external API (Pokedex) and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

Features/Goals:
- loads data from an external API source
- views a list of items in a grid display
- upon user action, modal pop-up displays further details of each item

# Design & Build
The application uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript functions as well as polyfills, bootstrap & jQuery to enhance the functionality and design through modals, buttons, and a navbar.
I was the sole designer and developer for this application; ESLint and minified files were used at end of project to maintain consistent & clean code for output.

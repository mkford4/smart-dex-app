# Smart-Dex or Pokedex APP

A small web application with HTML, CSS, and JS that loads the Pokedex API for viewing.

Features:
- loads data from an external API source
- views a list of items in a grid display
- upon user action, modal pop-up displays further details of each item
- user can use filter bar to search for specific names of items (ex. Pokemon names)

Design & Build:
The application uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript functions as well as polyfills, bootstrap & jQuery to enhance the functionality and design through modals, buttons, and a navbar.

Screenshot shows the app with a modal open showing further details of Pokemon displayed.

(I was the sole designer and developer for this application, with ESLint included to clean up and create consistent code.)
